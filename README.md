# ReactPractice

Practicing React

This repository contains a minimal Vite + React scaffold created for experimentation.

How to run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 (or the URL printed by Vite) — the Home page has a link to "Memory Game" which navigates to `/memory_game`.

Where to implement the Memory Game

Implement game components inside `src/pages/memory_game` (the placeholder component is `MemoryGame.jsx`).
